### To-do
(http://to-do-minimal.rf.gd/) A project made for Javascript studies, which works as a "to-do list".

I'm beggining in **Javascript** and I taking a course [here](https://rocketseat.com.br/) and a other course [here](https://www.ctrlplay.com.br/) 

The course challenge was make a "to-do" project with these functions:
- [x] Add a task;
- [x] Remove a task;
- [x] Save the task in the local storage.

How to test:
- Download the folder (or use git clone);
- Open the index.html file.
